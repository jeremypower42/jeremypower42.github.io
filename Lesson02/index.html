                Fitt's law stats that the larger and object is the easier it is for the user to 
                access that object.In web design this mostly refers to the size of button on a site.
                the site for tuts.com does a great job of this. Having 4 very large eaesy to access 
                buttons at the top of thier page.

                The rule of thirds simply means to place a 3 x 3 grid over a picture and use this grid to 
                ensure that there is proportion within the grid. This idea has been around since the 1700's
                nd is used so much people don't even realize that it is being used. One great website is
                Neve and Hawk web site, as you scrool through the site the rule of third changes it ratio'
                yet still does an amazing job of keeping visually plesing.

            <p>
                Amazon uses the <b>Hick's Law</b> design principle by
                making their site very simple to use. With not a lot of choices
                at first forthe user. THis hlps the user make decision faster, and 
                keeps them on the web site for longer has they explore thier options.
